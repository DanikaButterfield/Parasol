# Parasol

I am a simple girl with simple needs. One of those needs is to not walk out of the house without my umbrella.

So, I introduce Parasol. A simple, yet very useful tool for creating checklists of all the things you should have before leaving the house in the morning.

# Features

As a user, Parasol allows you to create your own checklists, with any number of items. Once created, the checklist can be opened, and the items checked off as you acquire them. When you're done, simply exit the checklist menu, and the list will reset for the next time you use it. 

Parasol also supports editing existing lists, allowing users to rename their lists, add any number of additional items to them, and even delete them if they are no longer needed.
